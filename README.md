# Description

The repository contains two folders:

* ``figures``, which contains the figures showcasing _all_ our results (over 200 figures in total);
* ``code``, containing the resources of our technical implementation (including our complete results). 

We also provide the ``supplementary.pdf``, containing additional descriptions and explanations on some of the procedures followed in the paper.

Finally, we provide a demonstrative video ``stat-test.mp4`` showcasing how we carried out our statistical tests.

For more information on the paper, refer to the personal Webpage of Giovanni Apruzzese (https://www.giovanniapruzzese.com/publications/aisec24).
